Google ARCore Extensions for AR Foundation
==========================================
Copyright 2019 Google LLC

This package provides extensions to Unity's AR Foundation cross platform
Augmented Reality API. It also provides native APIs for features provided by
Google ARCore. With these extensions you can build new AR experiences or
enhance existing apps with AR features.

This package does not yet provide access to all ARCore APIs and capabilities.
If one or more of those features are required by your project, consider using
the [ARCore SDK for Unity](//developers.google.com/ar/develop/downloads)
until those features have been added to this package.

developer guide.


## API Reference

## Release Notes

The package release notes are available on the
[releases](//github.com/google-ar/arcore-unity-extensions/releases) page.


## Terms & Conditions

By downloading the ARCore Extensions for AR Foundation, you agree that the
[**ARCore Additional Terms of Service**](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/terms)
governs your use thereof.


## User privacy requirements

You must disclose the use of Google Play Services for AR (ARCore) and how it
collects and processes data, prominently in your application, easily accessible
to users. You can do this by adding the following text on your main menu or
notice screen: "This application runs on
[Google Play Services for AR](//play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core)
(ARCore), which is provided by Google LLC and governed by the

## Deprecation policy

Apps built with **ARCore SDK 1.12.0 or higher** are covered by the
[Cloud Anchor API deprecation policy](//developers.google.com/ar/distribute/deprecation-policy).

Apps built with **ARCore SDK 1.11.0 or lower** will be unable to host or resolve
Cloud Anchors beginning December 2020 due to the SDK's use of an older,
deprecated ARCore Cloud Anchor service.
